# Steps for Solubility Measurement in the Lab Experiment

## 1. Select the Compound
- **Criteria**: Choose the compound based on toxicity, hazardousness, availability, and ease of handling.

## 2. Measure and Weigh Substances
- **Weigh the Compound**: Example, weigh 5 mg of the substance.
- **Measure the Solvent**: Use two pipettes (20-200 µL and 100-1000 µL ranges).
- **Prepare Initial Solution**: Mix the compound with an equal amount of solvent (e.g., Water or DMSO) to achieve a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL.

## 3. Prepare Normal Solutions
- **Make 5 Different Concentrations**: Follow these steps:
  - **a)** 500 µL substance (1 mg/mL)
  - **b)** 800 µL substance + 200 µL Acetonitrile (0.8 mg/mL)
  - **c)** 600 µL substance + 400 µL Acetonitrile (0.6 mg/mL)
  - **d)** 400 µL substance + 600 µL Acetonitrile (0.4 mg/mL)
  - **e)** 200 µL substance + 800 µL Acetonitrile (0.2 mg/mL)

## 4. HPLC Analysis of Normal Solutions
- **Load Samples**: Place the 5 vials in the HPLC column.
- **Check Solvent Levels**: Ensure sufficient solvent is present; replace or adjust settings if necessary.
- **Record Method Used**: Note the method (e.g., ACN_10_99_5MIN), column number, and injection volume (5 µL).

## 5. Prepare Saturated Solution
- **a)** Weigh the substance.
- **b)** Add 1 mL of solvent to the substance.
- **c)** Add a magnet to stir for 24 hours.
- **d)** Centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes.
- **e)** Take 100 µL from the saturated solution and add 900 µL Acetonitrile.
- **f)** Analyze with HPLC using the same settings as the normal solution.
- **g)** Record the HPLC area for the saturated solution.

## 6. Plotting the Calibration Curve
- **Create the Graph**: Plot the concentration of the 5 normal solutions on the x-axis and their corresponding HPLC areas on the y-axis.
- **Determine Slope and Intercept**: Use the graph to calculate the linear relationship between concentration and area.

## 7. Calculate Saturated Solution Concentration
- **Apply the Formula**: 
  \[
  \text{Y (concentration)} = \frac{\text{Area of Saturated Solution} - \text{Intercept}}{\text{Slope}}
  \]
- **Determine Final Solubility**: Multiply \( Y \) by 10 to convert the concentration from the 100 µL sample to the standard 1 mL sample, reflecting the total solubility in mg/mL.
